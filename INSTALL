Building the Rate Measurement Framework (RMF)
=============================================


Prerquesites:
-------------
- stlsoft >= 1.9.117
- pantheios >= 1.0.1-beta214
- google-perftools


1) Installation of the logging framework prerequesites:
=======================================================
For convenience stlsoft verion 1.9.118-hdrs and pantheios 1.0.1-beta214 with pachtes for gcc 4.7 and 4.8 are included in the dependencies directory.
Current versions can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pantheios/.

1. Unpack them to directories of your liking (we will assume /opt/stlsoft and /opt/pantheios)

2. Set environment Variables for pantheios in your shell (for example ~/.bashrc):
	export STLSOFT=/opt/stlsoft
	export PANTHEIOS_ROOT=/opt/pantheios

3. Change to the pantheios build directory corresponding to your gcc version and architecture.
   For 64-Bit x86 and gcc 4.8 this would be
   cd /opt/pantheios/build/gcc48.unix.file64bit   

4. If multiple g++ or gcc versions are installed and you do not want to use those invoked by gcc and g++ change the makefile in this directory from
>
########################################
# tools

CC                      =   gcc
CPPC                    =   g++
AR                      =   ar
LD                      =   g++

to:

CC                      =   gcc-4.8
CPPC                    =   g++-4.8 
AR                      =   ar
LD                      =   g++-4.8 
<

or (for 32 Bit cross compiles) to:

>
########################################
# tools

CC                      =   gcc-4.8 -m32
CPPC                    =   g++-4.8 -m32
AR                      =   ar
LD                      =   g++-4.8 -m32
<

5. Build pantheios by
   "make build" or (32-Bit cross compile) "linux32 make build"



2) Building the RMF:
--------------------
1. Change to the directory this file is contained in.

2. If you chose other paths for pantheois and stlsoft than /opt/pantheios and /pot/stlsoft change the variables 
LOG_P and LOG_S in the Makefile correspondingly.

3. If you changed the g++ call for panthois in 1.4) please alswo change the GPP variable in the Makefile.

4. build the rmf binary by calling
	"make", "make 64-bit" or "make 32-bit"

5. the rmf binary now should be located at binary/rmf


3) Building and loading the Kernel Module:
------------------------------------------
1. make sure you have installed the kernel headers of your currently used header

2. go to source/queueReadModule

3. call "make"

4. the kernel module can be load by 
   "insmod queueLength.ko deviceName=DEVNAME"
   where DEVNAME is the name of the device to monitor
